      <p>
        Hey there, my name is Julien Henry. I live in France, more precisely in
        Burgundy. I’ve always been interested in computing and technology. One
        of my other passions is sport. After acquiring a bachelor's degree to be
        a physical education professor, I’ve realized that sport was just a
        hobby but not my future job.
      </p>

      <p>
        After months of solo learning, I’ve decided to take the web developer
        training course at OpenClassrooms. Following this, I’m currently looking
        for my first experience as a front end developer.
