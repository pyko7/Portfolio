# Portfolio

Welcome to the V3 of my [portfolio](https://www.julienhenry.fr) !

I'm Julien, a front end developer based in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I'm currently looking for my first professional experience as a front end developer in remote.
I have interest in technology since a long time now and 1 year ago I've decided to quit my job and take a training course in web development.
I'm also a sportsman, a music enthusiast and a musician.

You'll find more details about me on my [portfolio](https://www.julienhenry.fr) and feel free to contact me if you have some questions !
